# React-News-Spring-Web-App
Using React, tailwind, Javascript and News API ,I have created the news website for daily news reading online , we can read the news section wise like Business, Entertainment, Science and many more.

If you want to run this website,

you first fork it or download the code into your system,
then you copy this code as it in your VS code or your text Editor ,if API is not working the go to [https://newsapi.org/] here and make account and access free API ,copy any one of that API and paste it into URL of API in website,
for running the website you need to download first is NPM and then on TERMINAL you write command 'npm start' after it goes to browser and then open the website successfully.
